@deftypefun {void} close_bt ({HAND *} @var{han})

Closes and frees @var{han}; the b-tree associated with @var{han}
remains in the segment.
@end deftypefun


For @code{create-db} and @code{open-db}, the implicit @var{WCB}
argument is the combination of @samp{WCB-SAP} and @samp{WCB-SAR}.

@deftypefun {HAND *} create_db ({SEGD *} @var{seg}, {int} @var{typ}, {unsigned char *} @var{name_str})

Returns a B-tree whose name has been entered in the root directory
if successful; otherwise null.

@var{typ} should be either

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{'D'} (directory) or
@item @code{'T'} (regular tree).
@end itemize

B-trees with @var{typ} @code{#\D} which are pointed to by special
entries in the root block (1) protect all their special entries from
garbage collection by the @code{wbcheck} program.  @code{'T'} is for
regular (data) arrays.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {HAND *} open_db ({SEGD *} @var{seg}, {unsigned char *} @var{name_str})

Returns the B-tree whose name has been entered in the root directory;
or null if not found.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {int} flush_ents ({int} @var{attempts}, {int} @var{k})

@var{k} is the number of dirty block buffers to write to disk;
@var{attempts} is the number of times to try.  Note that blocks in any
segment may be written by @code{flush-ents}.  @code{flush-ents}
returns the number of blocks written.
